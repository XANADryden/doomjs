# doomjs


This is a project to port the id tech 1 (original doom) engine to js.

WE NEED HELP.  We can't do this alone.  If you want to contribute, just make a pull request.  

To use this, you MUST have the doom wad.  We would provide it, but id has changed, and we don't want to be sued.

This port is going for 100% engine accuracy, and will give options for changing controls, a dev console, and nothing else. (unless you make it optional)
