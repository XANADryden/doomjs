# doomjs


This is a project to port the id tech 1 (original doom) engine to js.

I NEED HELP.  I can't do this alone.  If you want to contribute, just make a pull request.  If anyone can give me pointers (hehe) to a good C reference, that would be amazing.

To use this, you MUST have the doom wad.  I would provide it, but id has changed, and I don't want to be sued.

This port is going for 100% engine accuracy, and will give options for changing controls, and nothing else.
